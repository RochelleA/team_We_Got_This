Please follow this new guideline for storing in the repository. 

Documentation folder: this folder is for any written work. It is split primarily into reports and policies.
If the document you are adding to the repository is about a policy or specification of the system, i.e a class diagram, please add it to the diagram and specification folder. 
If the document you are adding is a report on your current implementation and how it works, please add it to the report folder under final report. 
if your document is not classed as any of the above please add it to the miscellaneous folder. 



Software: 
If the software is part of our older models, it should be placed in the initial work folder.
If the software is part of the new simulation, please add it to the final model folder - making a new folder where necessary.
