	\section*{ Action Points}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Rochelle will restructure the git folder to remove named folders and now include feature specific folders.
		\item Everyone will push to their individual git branches before pushing to master. 
		Only finished code, diagrams or reports will be added to the master branch. 
		\item Everyone will remember to sync their folders before adding any code to it. 
		This will minimize the number of clashes. 
		\item Nur will work on building the cells, cars and GUI using the class files that Anton has created. 
		In using predefined class files, the other members of the group will know which methods they will be able to use in the implementation of the feature they are working on.
		\item Zaki will work on building the traffic controller and the GUI. 
		\item Anton will code the map builder.
		\item kim will resize the grass,road and car pictures to three different sizes-10x10, 15x15 and 20x20.
