{\underline	{\bf Agenda}}\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a brief get together so everyone can meet, discuss our ideas for the simulation and understand everyone's strengths and weakness
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
	
	{\underline {\bf Action Points}}\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We would like to build the project's back-end in Java and have action script as our GUI as Kim and Anton our familiar with it. 
		\item Our main focus is making sure we have a working structure to present so we will focus on that and then play with other variable later in the project. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	
\newpage
\noindent Below is a our first idea for a model. We are not sure if it is feasible in the time frame but it will serve as or final gaol if there is time. We would like to build a model with several different junctions. This will allow us to include traffic which responds to traffic lights but also a more challenging task of insureing the cars in our simulation give way at roundabouts or at a T-junction.
