	{\underline{\bf{Action Points}}\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is not a good idea to forge ahead in coding without trying to first decide on the plan for timings
		\item We need to close follow the idea of Waterfall method which means focusing now on the design of our system.
		\item It is not a good idea to split the team into back-end and GUI. We should concentrate on the back-end and only later try to implement a GUI.
		\item We need to design UML diagrams and case diagrams of our system 
		\item we need case diagrams for all of our enities such as the map,car, buses. 
		\item we need to consider what our policy is because apart from a correct system, this will be the most important feature of our system. 
		\item perhaps our policy could be speed limits in different zones of our model or maybe modelling overtaking.  
	\end{itemize}
